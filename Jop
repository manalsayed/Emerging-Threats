**Introduction**
As cyber threats continue to evolve, organizations must stay vigilant against new and emerging attack techniques. The Emerging Cyber Threats 2023 repository compiles a list of the key cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities that have grown in prominence this year. This information will help security teams and organizations prepare for and respond to emerging risks.

**Emerging Threats**
Hereâ€™s a summary of the significant emerging cyber threats identified in 2023:

Ransomware Evolution:
Ransomware continues to evolve with more sophisticated techniques. Attackers now use double-extortion tactics, where data is not only encrypted but also stolen and threatened to be released unless a ransom is paid. Targeted attacks against healthcare and critical infrastructure sectors have also become more frequent.

Supply Chain Attacks:
Cybercriminals and nation-state actors are increasingly targeting supply chains to gain access to larger organizations. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in third-party vendors, software providers, and service providers, often affecting businesses indirectly.

Cloud Security Risks:
As organizations move more services to the cloud, the risk of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in cloud environments has increased. Unsecured cloud storage (e.g., open Amazon S3 buckets), weak access controls, and inadequate cloud security configurations remain prime attack vectors.

Credential Stuffing and Identity Theft:
With the rise in data breaches, attackers are exploiting stolen credentials to conduct credential stuffing attacks. By using previously stolen username and password combinations, attackers attempt to break into user accounts across multiple platforms, often targeting systems with weak or reused passwords.

IoT Vulnerabilities:
The number of IoT devices continues to grow, and many of these devices lack adequate security controls. This makes them vulnerable to exploitation. Cybercriminals have been using IoT devices to launch botnet attacks and as entry points into networks.
